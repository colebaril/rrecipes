# Recipe Web Scraping

This code is to scrape recipes from the web using R and the [`rvest`](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/) package.

Currently works for allrecipes.com and foodnetwork.ca. Adding more sites in my spare time, as this is a hobby project.

# How to Use

1. Download or copy code from the "Scraper" .R file. Ensure you have the necessary packages.
2. Paste URLs in the URL Input section, following the formatting. Make sure it is the URL for a single recipe. 
3. Ensure all functions are ran (scrapers, extra functions). 
4. Run the executable function. 
5. The recipes will now be saved in your working directory folder as a .txt file and printed in the console.
