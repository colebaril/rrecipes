# Recipe Web Scraping

This code is to scrape recipes from the web using R and the [`rvest`](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/) package.

Currently works for allrecipes.com and foodnetwork.ca. Adding more sites in my spare time, as this is a hobby project.

# How to Use

1. Paste URLs in the URL Input section, following the formatting. Make sure it is the URL for a single recipe. 
2. Ensure all functions are ran (scrapers, extra functions). 
3. Run the executable function. 
4. The recipes will now be saved in your working directory folder as a .txt file and printed in the console.
